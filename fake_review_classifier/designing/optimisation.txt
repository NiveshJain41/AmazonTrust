Key Optimizations Made:
1. Removed Heavy NLP Libraries

❌ Removed language_tool_python (grammar checking)
❌ Removed nltk word corpus (spell checking)
✅ Replaced with simple regex-based text analysis

2. Simplified Feature Extraction

Before: Individual processing with grammar/spell checking for each review
After: Vectorized operations using pandas .str methods
Speed Gain: ~10-20x faster

3. Reduced Model Complexity

Random Forest: 100 → 50 estimators
Gradient Boosting: 100 → 50 estimators
TF-IDF features: 1000 → 200 features
Added max_depth limits to prevent overfitting

4. Optimized Text Features
Instead of grammar/spelling errors, now using:

Review length and word count
Exclamation marks and caps ratio
Special character patterns
Word repetition detection
